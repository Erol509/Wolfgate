# Performance

Small fixes for hot spots found in live server profiles, kept as narrow hooks into upstream systems.

- `WFCollectionExtensions.ClearAndTrim` clears a reused scratch set and frees its storage after a crowded query, so
  atmos and mover lookups don't keep paying for one huge pile of items.
- `SharedGravitySystem.WFRefresh` batches weightlessness refreshes for half a second after a grid's gravity changes and
  walks only that grid's entities, instead of every gravity-affected entity on the server per change.
- `PathfindingSystem` skips mining rock grids (`WFAsteroidGridComponent`). Building their nav chunks cost about 2.6 ms
  per new rock grid, nearly all the cost of a field loading in, and no NPC walks on one.
- `DockingSystem.WFPlacement` speeds up the dock search a ship purchase or FTL dock runs: pairs of docks that would put
  the ship somewhere else are ruled out before the tile check rather than after it, and the tile check skips the
  station's empty chunks. It picks the same dock as before; a six-dock ship at a 77-dock station went from seconds to
  about 60 ms.
- Worldgen churn: a space chunk stays loaded for `wf.worldgen.unload_grace` seconds (60) after nothing needs it
  (`WorldControllerSystem.WFUnloadGrace`), and a GC queue's `minAge` holds entities that long before deleting them
  (`GCQueueSystem.WFMinAge`; `WFAsteroids` waits 60 s). A ship that comes back within the grace keeps the asteroid
  fields around it instead of unloading and respawning them.
- `WFAsteroidCullSystem` stops sending every worldgen rock grid to every player. A player is sent a rock grid once one
  of their views comes within `wf.asteroids.send_range` (128 m) and keeps it until the rock is deleted, since the
  client can't detach a grid. Each worldgen chunk with rocks gets a field entity (`WFAsteroidFieldComponent`), sent to
  everyone, listing its rocks' position, rotation and look; on the client `WFAsteroidFieldSystem` reads it so radar
  (`ShuttleNavControl.WFAsteroidFields`) and the far overlay draw rocks whose grids haven't been sent. Rocks no chunk
  owns are sent to everyone as before, `ChunkingSystem` skips rock grids (they hold no decals or gas), and
  `wf.asteroids.cull false` turns it all off live.
- Roofs network as chunk deltas (`SharedRoofSystem.WFDelta`). Maps go to every player, and a cavern map's full roof
  is tens of kilobytes; each tile change on the surface above resent all of it, which emptied clients' state buffers.
  A delta carries only the chunks changed since the client's last ack.
- Radar requests share one walk of the blips per tick (`RadarBlipSystem.WFCache`), which sorts them into squares so a
  request skips the squares out of its reach, and console nav states share one walk of the docks for up to half a
  second, or until something docks or undocks (`ShuttleConsoleSystem.WFDocks`). The server answers one player's blip
  requests at most `wf.radar.max_request_hz` times a second (10); lower it under load.
- Radar consoles ask for blips at `wf.radar.request_hz` (15 a second) instead of twice a second, so a turning missile
  stops lurching between straight-line guesses, and the console finds each blip's grid from its own coordinates instead
  of a spatial query per blip per frame. `ShuttleNavControl`'s radar interval was zero, which divided by zero and drew
  the sweep line to a NaN point.
- `WFPlanetDragSystem` walks the children of planet layers instead of every grid. Suit sensors, APCs, sound spammers and
  pickup magnets look for due work every third tick, locality loaders check twice a second, and a dry auto-drain
  searches for puddles every 5 s.
- A drydock break lifts its finished tiles together every 10 s (`WFDrydockJobComponent.Lifting`) instead of one at a
  time, since each lift resends every fixture of the hull (about 9 KB on a derelict, 50 KB on a big ship) to every player.
- The client Z-level sprite passes (`CEClientZLevelsPreAnimSystem`, `CEClientZLevelsPostAnimSystem`) walk only
  entities off the ground or just landed (`CESharedZLevelsSystem.WFRaised`), instead of every entity with Z physics.
  The full walk over about 52,000 entities took 38% of a live client's game thread. A height joins the list from
  server state, prediction or `SetZPosition`, so raise an entity through those rather than writing `LocalPosition`.
- Nav map deltas (`NavMapComponent.WFDelta`) name the chunks removed since the client's ack instead of listing every
  chunk on the grid, which cost about 30 KB per update on a planet map. The history keeps the newest removals
  (`NavMapSystem.WFRemoved`), and a client behind what it dropped gets a full state.
- A ship sale no longer stalls the tick. `WFHullRetireSystem` (in `_WF/Shipyard`) parks the hull on a paused map, then
  serialises and deletes it 4 ms per tick, and writes the YAML text on a worker. All at once, a 2,750-entity hull took
  about 600 ms to serialise and 150 ms to delete. It logs `Retired <hull>: copy ... delete ... longest ...`.
- One-second jobs take a tick each instead of landing together (`WFTickSpread`): radius heaters and drains. Wound
  overlay refreshes take a share per tick, and fixture damage and the atmos alerts console start on their own offsets.
  Radius heaters also look only for loose things to warm, not anchored or stored ones.
- `IgnitionSourceSystem` walks only lit sources (`WFLit`), and a ship's shield follows it with one transform call.
- More one-second jobs stop landing on one tick: Wolfmed body ticks are spread with `WFTickSpread`, and encounter
  zones, ship status, crew ship status, cargo load and thermal signatures each start on their own part of the second.
- AI ship steering works every other tick and holds its input between (`ShipSteeringSystem`), and `FlammableSystem`
  looks for what's due every third tick.
- NPC ship crews cost less in a fleet fight. A gunner's costlier post checks and target re-checks run four times a second
  (`WFGunnerDutySystem.HoldsPost`), guns are aimed every other tick (`ShipTargetingSystem.WFAimPeriod`; a shot attempt
  lasts 0.2 s, so firing doesn't stop between), and steering runs its area searches every third turn and skips the
  sector maths when nothing is near.
- `WFDeletedRefStateSystem` hand-writes the state of components whose references can outlive what they point at
  (projectiles, deeds, guest access, station grids). A generated state logged an error with a stack trace per deleted
  reference, per send, on the PVS threads. A deleted reference goes out as invalid, and set entries are left out.
- `WFGridDeleteWatchSystem` logs any grid that takes at least 50 ms to delete, by name and entity count.
- The marked upstream edits skip idle-shuttle thruster work, avoid `Enum.GetValues` and nullable boxing on per-tick
  paths, stop `FlammableSystem` from crashing when igniting queues new fire events, and stop networking a thrown
  item's shooter (it outlived the shooter and sent a deleted entity every state).

## Non-modular edits

- [`Content.Client/_CE/ZLevels/Core/CEClientZLevelsSystem.cs`](../../../Content.Client/_CE/ZLevels/Core/CEClientZLevelsSystem.cs)
  - a height from the server joins the sprite passes
  - spawned off the ground
  - the raised list and the lookup that replace the all-entity query
  - walk only raised entities; nothing else has a height to strip
  - the raised list and the lookups that replace the all-entity query
  - walk only raised entities; one that has landed leaves the list
  - removed after the walk, which can't change the set it enumerates
- [`Content.Client/_Mono/Radar/RadarBlipsSystem.cs`](../../../Content.Client/_Mono/Radar/RadarBlipsSystem.cs)
  - blips arrived at 2 Hz, so a curving missile lurched between straight-line guesses.
  - lookups and colours for the missile lines, which are rebuilt on every draw frame
  - removals arrive one batch a tick
  - the sent coord already names its grid, so only an off-grid blip needs the query
  - one dictionary lookup per missile, not a scan of every blip per missile.
- [`Content.Client/Atmos/Consoles/AtmosMonitoringConsoleNavMapControl.cs`](../../../Content.Client/Atmos/Consoles/AtmosMonitoringConsoleNavMapControl.cs): wizden#38974, subnets carry a Color instead of a hex string

- [`Content.Client/Shuttles/UI/ShuttleNavControl.xaml.cs`](../../../Content.Client/Shuttles/UI/ShuttleNavControl.xaml.cs)
  - the sweep divided by the zero interval, so the sweep hand keeps a period of its own.
  - the sweep hand's own timer, since the request accumulator is zeroed each frame
  - the sweep hand turns on its own timer, so it keeps moving while requests are throttled
  - this divided by a zero interval and drew the sweep to a NaN point every frame
  - distant rocks from their field lists
- [`Content.Client/Weapons/Ranged/Systems/GunSystem.cs`](../../../Content.Client/Weapons/Ranged/Systems/GunSystem.cs): wizden#36641, was EntityUid

  - drain pass timing
  - a battery swap is handled on the next tick instead of waiting for the 1 s pass
  - make the next drain pass due immediately
  - every silicon drains on a 1 s accumulator; NPCs keep their cvar delay
  - drainTime replaces frameTime
  - the event fan-out and speed refresh only matter when the state changes
- [`Content.Server/_EinsteinEngines/Silicon/Death/Systems/SiliconChargeDeathSystem.cs`](../../_EinsteinEngines/Silicon/Death/Systems/SiliconChargeDeathSystem.cs): already dead, nothing to redo

  - see Update
  - SpreaderGrid is created lazily by the first spreader on the grid
  - create the grid's queues on first use
  - empty queues for a grid that just got its first spreader; no scan, so spreaders still waiting for MapInit are not queued twice
