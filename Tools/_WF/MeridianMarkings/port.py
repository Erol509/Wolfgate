"""Ports Meridian Rift's character markings into Wolfgate.

Meridian Rift (https://github.com/Aphelion-Moon/Meridian-Rift) is an SS13 server on the NovaSector
codebase. Its tails, ears, snouts, horns, frills, wings, hair and the rest are sprite accessory datums
drawn from DMI sheets, and its body markings are datums that draw one state per body part. This reads
both out of a Meridian Rift checkout, drops every marking Wolfgate already has, and writes what is left
as RSIs, marking prototypes and names under the MeridianMarkings module.

What the SS13 art becomes here:

    layers      An accessory draws on up to three SS13 layers. Everything above the body is merged
                into one sprite per colour, keeping the game's own stacking; art below the body
                becomes a second sprite on TailBehind that follows the first one's colour.
    tails       Keep that split, so a tail is in front of the mob facing north and behind it facing
                south as it was drawn. South-facing art that could cover anatomy is moved behind the
                body with the zone Tools/_WF/Genitals/tails measures, which is what the tests check.
    wagging     A tail with wagging states gets an <id>Animated variant with the same sprites.
    body        One marking per body part, like the markings already here. Art the foot or hand
                sprite would cover is cut out of the limb; a leg's foot art is its own marking.
                A set with any part ported keeps all of them, and its left and right parts go to
                the same species.
    hair        One sprite per style, with the ponytails and braids SS13 layers around headwear
                laid over it. The human hair here was redrawn from the same SS13 styles, so a style is
                also dropped when one of the same name or state is here and sits in the same place.
    species     Accessories go to the species the anthro parts already here are offered to, hair to
                everyone as the human hair here is. A body marking goes to every species whose body
                part has the shape of the human one, which is the body all of this art was drawn on.

Left out: what nobody can pick in the source game, hair gradients, underwear and anatomy (not
markings), taur bodies (no such body here), digitigrade leg art (drawn for a leg no species here has),
IPC screens (drawn for another head, and the same set is here already), Teshari parts (Resomi carry
that set) and Vox body markings, beaks and hair (drawn for the SS13 Vox, whose body the Vox here do
not share).

    python Tools/_WF/MeridianMarkings/port.py --source <Meridian-Rift checkout> --review <folder>
