"""Ports Meridian Rift's clothing into Wolfgate.

Meridian Rift (https://github.com/Aphelion-Moon/Meridian-Rift) is an SS13 server on the NovaSector codebase.
This reads every wearable /obj/item/clothing type out of a Meridian Rift checkout (tgstation's, NovaSector's and
Meridian's own), drops what Wolfgate already has, and writes the rest as RSIs, entity prototypes, names,
loadouts and vending stock under the MeridianClothing module.

What the SS13 art becomes here:

    sprites     Each item gets one RSI: its icon, its worn sprite as the slot's equipped state and its in-hand
                sprites. Frames take the largest art's size; icons are centred, and worn and in-hand art sits
                where BYOND draws it (from the tile's corner, centred by its declared size). Species get the
                human sprite through their displacement maps (Vox, Resomi, Avali, the LegStyle legs), never the
                SS13 species sheets, which were drawn for bodies the species here don't have.
    greyscale   A GAGS item is drawn from its configs as one layer per colour, adjacent layers of one colour
                merged. A layer's state ends in -c<N> for colour slot N and starts at the SS13 default; the
                WFGags component (Gags module) recolours them, and the loadout window lets players pick.
                Blends the engine can't layer (multiply, add) are baked in the default colours.
    function    A type whose SS13 job is protection (armour, helmets, EVA suits, gas masks, HUDs, insulated
                gloves, bio and radiation gear) takes the Wolfgate item with that job as its parent. On top of
                that every item gets what its own SS13 stats give it, whatever its typepath: armour values,
                insulation (siemens 0), internals (a mask that takes them), pressure, fire and cold protection,
                flash protection, HUDs, no-slip and slowdown. Protective items are not put in loadouts or
                vending machines: their price and balance are the server's call, so they are admin and
                mapping spawns until someone places them. SS13 traits with no counterpart here (fast cuffing,
                quiet steps, the admin suit's immunities) are left out.
    duplicates  An item is already here when its worn sprite in its default colours matches a worn state of
                any RSI here, or when a plain (single-colour) item shares the name of a clothing item here.
                Meridian's own subtypes that share their sprites are one item.

Left out: abstract types, items with no icon or worn sprite, plasmaman suits (no such species here), MOD and
chameleon gear, magboots, night-vision and thermal glasses, taur, digitigrade and species sheets (displacement
maps fit the human sprite instead), adjusted and toggled states (rolled jumpsuits, open jackets), and hoods
as part of their coat (a hood is its own head item).

Distribution: each item gets a theme from its typepath (security, medical, cargo, costume, ...). A loadout
group gets the items whose theme matches one of the roles using it and whose slot is the group's. Faction
roles (TSFMC, USSP, PDV, MMC, Viper Group, ASF) keep their uniforms. Civilian roles also get the recolourable
bunny outfit. Vending machines get their department's items; ClothesMate gets the everyday civilian clothes.
AutoDrobe's recolourable items never run out. Adult, admin and antagonist items go nowhere.
